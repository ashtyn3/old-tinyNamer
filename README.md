# tinyNamer

tinyNamer provides a new system for the web to work on. A decentralized one.

# Block structure

Parts of the blocks hash:

- The previous blocks hash.
- Metadata about that block.


## Block Metadata

Block metadata contains the following info:

- The sites ending (.com, .net).
- The address of the people validating the block.

# Transactions

# Btokens

btokens are the currency behind transactions. You can invest other cryptocurrencies into btokens. 

100 unamed Btokens are put into circulation at the start of the chain. Each person gets 5 Ctokens. Each token is completely unique from one another. The Btokens are put up for a bid on the network. You pay the bid using Ctokens. Let's say you invest all 5 Ctokens into the btoken, 2% of that 5 is paid towards the nodes running the bid and a changing gas price is also taken out as a payment to a distrbuted vault. A Btoken is a essentially a named place in a future block. The name of a Btoken has to be unique from other peoples Btokens but can be decided by the owner. Btokens with the same name are treated as the same data (wesbite). Each Btoken is another node storing the data (your website or server) you want to serve in their blocks. The more Btokens you own with the same name the more priorty your data gets. The node is only able to except 50 Btokens of the same data. Each node is able to decide which data suggestions (websites) to host in their block. They decide on data based the following:

1) How long each of your Btokens has existed.
2) How many other nodes have hosted it.
3) How many Btokens share the same name.


The amount of time needed for a Btoken to be excepted by a node is the amount of peers on the network divided by how many blocks that node has created in hours. If there are 200 peers on the network and that node has created 20 blocks then the minimum amount of time a Btoken can exist can be excepted by that node is 10 hours. This system motivates people to keep there Btokens and data in circulation for longer. This also makes it so data hosting is more distrbuted across nodes. Just like with other currencies don't put all your eggs in one basket.

How many other nodes have hosted it is a random number seeded from that nodes id.

How many Btokens share the same name is
